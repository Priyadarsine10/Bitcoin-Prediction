**📝 Bitcoin Price Analysis & Prediction**

**Project Title:**
Bitcoin Price Prediction using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning

Team: Crypto Analysts
Institution: SASTRA Deemed University
Department: SASHE
Date: May 8

**📌 Overview**

This project applies time series analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Using historical Bitcoin data, the system identifies trends, patterns, and volatility, and provides predictive modeling for future prices. The project integrates visualization tools to display historical performance, moving averages, and forecasting results, enabling better understanding of cryptocurrency market behavior.

**🎯 Objectives**

 -Collect and preprocess Bitcoin historical price dataset

 -Perform statistical and time-series analysis on BTC price data

 -Engineer relevant features such as moving averages, returns, and volatility

 -Apply and compare machine learning models for prediction

 -Develop a web interface (optional) for interactive Bitcoin analysis

**🧠 Machine Learning / Analytical Models Used**
 
 -ARIMA / SARIMA – for time series forecasting

 -LSTM Neural Networks – to capture long-term dependencies in BTC price trends

 -Random Forest Regressor – for supervised learning prediction

 -Linear Regression / XGBoost – for baseline model comparison

 -Technical Indicators – Moving Average (MA), Exponential MA, RSI, MACD for feature engineering

**📈 Model Performance**
| Task                     | Best Model    | Accuracy / RMSE |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| Price Trend Forecasting  | LSTM          |      0.83       |
| Short-term Prediction    | ARIMA/SARIMA  |      0.72       |
| Feature-based Regression | Random Forest |      0.78       |

**🔍 Features Engineered**

Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (MA5, MA20, MA50), Bollinger Bands

Statistical Metrics: Daily returns, volatility measures

Lag Features: Previous-day prices as predictors

Time-based Features: Month, Weekday, Seasonality components

**🌐 Application Stack**

Backend / ML: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Deployment (Optional): Streamlit / Flask for interactive dashboards

**🚧 Challenges**

High volatility and unpredictability of Bitcoin prices

Need for large historical datasets for deep learning models

Overfitting in neural network models due to noisy financial data

External factors (regulations, market news) not captured in dataset

**🚀 Future Work**

Incorporate external features (Twitter/News sentiment, macroeconomic data)

Apply advanced deep learning models like Transformers for financial time series

Build a live web dashboard with auto-updating price feeds

Extend analysis to other cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc.)
